## SFH of Handlebodies

This is a python program that computes the graded sutured Floer homology of a sutured handlebody. This is a work in progress. So far the code computes SFH for a handlebody of genus 2 in the case where the train track giving the sutures is generic (triangle inequality is satisfied) and an extra parity condition is satisfied.

For examples, and more details see the Jupyter notebook [HandlebodyExamples](./HandlebodyExamples.ipynb).
